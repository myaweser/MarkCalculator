MarkCalculator
==============

Welcome, first release of Mark Calculator code. This was done a long time ago
so I'm sure there are tons of gross stuff in there, I'll  hopefully get to 
clean it up one day but for now, email me at ryanwils@gmail.com if you have 
any questions about it!

You can find it in the app store at https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mark-calculator/id434291749?mt=8

Hopefully writing a better README later on too...

Just please don't just take it and distribute it as your own, add something to it at the very least!
