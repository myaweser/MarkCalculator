Mark Calculator

Welcome, first release of Mark Calculator code. I haven't touched it in 
over a year so I'm sure there are tons of gross stuff in there, I'll 
hopefully get to clean it up one day but for now, email me at 
ryanwils@gmail.com if you have any questions about it!

Hopefully writing a better README later on too...
